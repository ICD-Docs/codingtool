# Related categories in perinatal chapter

When coding perinatal mortality, mostly the case is coded to Chapter 19. To simplify this and also to be able to keep the detail coming from the rest of the classification, ICD-11 Coding Tool provides you perinatal chapter alternative codes. 

If the search result has a perinatal code alternative, you'll see the K icon.

For example, the entity "Tuberculosis of eye" (1B12.1) has as related category in perinatal chapter the entity "Congenital tuberculosis" (KA61.0)
